Java Copy Constructor Example
This Java code demonstrates the concept of a copy constructor using a Copy class.

Overview
In object-oriented programming, a copy constructor is a special constructor used to create a new object as a copy of an existing object. It allows you to create a new instance with the same data as another instance of the same class.

Code Explanation
Copy Class (Copy.java):

The Copy class contains two data members: an integer a and a double b.
It defines two constructors:
A default constructor that initializes a to 10 and b to 10.5.
A copy constructor that takes another Copy object as an argument and copies its values to the new object.
CopyConstructor Class (CopyConstructor.java):

The main method in this class demonstrates the use of a copy constructor.
It creates two instances of the Copy class, one using the default constructor and another using the copy constructor.
Usage
Compile the Java code using a Java compiler or an integrated development environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
Run the compiled program to observe the output, which demonstrates the use of the copy constructor.
Example Output
10
10.5

10
10.5
In this example, we create two instances of the Copy class:

The first instance is created using the default constructor and displays the default values of a and b.
The second instance is created using the copy constructor, which copies the values from the first instance
